Unfortunately, due to the lack of flexibility and inconsistent location of swapping events, creating a positive change was something they had to fit into their schedules. Now, how do we fix this problem? \nA permanent swapping fashion space! One location, swap anytime, bring everyone. Not only will you be able to swap from the best selection of pre-loved fashion pieces, you can now upcycle and learn fashion tricks all at one place! We aim to provide convenience and flexibility on however and whenever you want to help us create a purpose-driven economy around sustainable fashion and conscious consumerism. The Fashion Pulpit is also the very first of its kind in Singapore. So as you can see, we have a lot to be excited about!  ",
